# MachUpX
A new implementation of Warren F. Phillips' numerical lifting-line algorithm, combining the best of MachUp Pro and MachUp_Py.

Written by Cory Goates (graduate student, USU)

Discussion of the numerical lifting-line algorithm can be found in the following sources:

W. F. Phillips and D. O. Snyder. "Modern Adaptation of Prandtl's
Classic Lifting-Line Theory", Journal of Aircraft, Vol. 37, No. 4
(2000), pp. 662-670.

W. F. Phillips, "Flow over Multiple Lifting Surfaces," Mechanics of
Flight, 2nd ed., Wiley, New Jersey, 2010, pp. 94 -107.

This version of MachUpX optionally incorporates changes to Phillips' algorithm to ensure grid convergence in the case of swept wings and wings in sideslip. More on this can be found in the following sources:
