"""
The purpose of this script is to demonstrate the functionality of MachUpX for modelling
a small swarm of drones. Run this script using:

$ python swarm_example.py

The input file is also written such that the same analyses will be performed if run using
the `python -m` command. This is done using:

$ python -m machupX swarm_input.json
